# Node.js/Express Setup with PostgreSQL

I put this together while I was learning PostgreSQL. It is a small application where you can create an account with CRUD functionality for posts. There are no styles, just the bare bones logic for setting up the backend with a database. My goal with this was to simply use Express/Node.js with a PostgreSQL database. Feel free to use it as you see fit.
